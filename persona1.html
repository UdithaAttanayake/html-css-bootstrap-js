                <h2>Demographics:</h2>
                <p>Anushka has been working at a startup for 3 years now. She is always working and busy during
                    weekends. On weekends she prefers to hang out and relax with friends. Her work takes up a lot of
                    time. She has been dabbing with the ideas of personal waste management for a couple of years. She
                    does not know where to start, she finds it stressful with loads of information she finds online. She
                    needs support to make herself a waste reduction plan. She often forgets to separate her waste.</p>
                <h2>Psychographic:</h2>
                <li>Likes transparancy[ operating in such a way that it is easy for others to see what actions are
                    performed.]</li>
                    <li>Tech-savvy.</li>
                    <li>Low attention span.</li>

                    <h2>Goals:</h2>
                    <p>Find information about the waste she is about to throw it in her bin.</p>
                    <p>Make a plan and reduce waste gradually.</p>
                    <p>Reuse whatever can be reused or give it away provide waste for recycling purposes.</p>
                    <h2>                    Frustrations:  </h2>
                    <p>It contains too many options Each website says a different thing.</p>
                    <p>It is very hard to keep my garbage in my house because collectors are coming twice a week.</p>
                    <p>Afraid waste management would not be possible given where she resides and the state of packaging</p>
